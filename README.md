Simple photo-viewer for windows. Uses stb to handle file loading and glfw to window management. I used OpenGL's Fixed Function Pipeline to render loaded images on window, which is definitely not the best way to do it. Currently supported file formats are PNG, JPG, TGA, BMP. There will be a raster editor in the future versions. Check out [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) version changes.
